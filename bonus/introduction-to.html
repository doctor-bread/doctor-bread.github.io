        Notepad&nbsp; - A simple text editor for Windows; it creates and
        edits<br />
        plain text documents. I wouldn't recommend this for making html files<br />
        though as it's very slow.<br />

        multiple open files in a single window. Basically notepad, but
        cooler.<br />
